## Dataset description

The dataset is used in
[VS Code workshop](https://github.com/iterative/VSCode-DVC-Workshop) for
predicting satellite kinematic orbit and run several experiments.

The dataset contains information about RSOs - artificial objects that are in
orbit around earth used to predict orbit trajectories.

Each row represents an orbit observation of a satellite. There are 600
satellites that have multiple observations. It is subdivided into three main
parts:
