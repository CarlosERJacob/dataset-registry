## Dataset description

The dataset is used in [VS Code workshop](https://github.com/iterative/VSCode-DVC-Workshop) 
for predicting satellite kinematic orbit and running several experiments.

The dataset contains information about RSOs - artificial objects that are in
orbit around the earth and used to predict orbit trajectories. Each row
represents an orbit observation of a satellite. There are 600
satellites that have multiple observations.
